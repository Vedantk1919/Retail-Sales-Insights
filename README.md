# 📊 Sales-Analytics-Dashboard

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive Business Intelligence solution designed to analyze retail sales performance across multiple regions. Built using **Microsoft Power BI**, it transforms raw transactional data into actionable insights, helping stakeholders identify trends in customer purchasing behavior, regional sales distribution, and product performance.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Microsoft Ecosystem)
- **Power BI Desktop**: Dashboarding and Data Visualization.
- **Power Query**: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes for data cleaning.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Complex measures for time-intelligence calculations (YoY Growth, MoM Sales).
- **Data Modeling**: Implemented a **Star Schema** architecture for optimized query performance.

## ⚙️ Key Features
- **ETL Pipeline**: Cleaned inconsistent data types and handled missing values using Power Query.
- **Dynamic Measures**: Created DAX formulas to calculate:
  - *Average Transaction Value (ATV)*
  - *Customer Retention Rate*
  - *Revenue vs. Target Analysis*
- **Interactive Visuals**: Implemented slicers for filtering by Region, Time Period, and Product Category.

## 🧠 Approach
1. **Data Ingestion**: Imported raw Excel data containing 1000+ transaction records.
2. **Data Modeling**: Established relationships between Fact tables (Transactions) and Dimension tables (Customers, Products, Time).
3. **Visualization**: Designed a user-centric layout focusing on "Z-pattern" reading flow for executives.
